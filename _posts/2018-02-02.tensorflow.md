# What is TensorFlow?
TensorFlow is a tool for machine learning. While it contains a wide range of functionality, TensorFlow is mainly designed for deep neural network models.
TensorFlow was developed by the Google Brain team for internal Google use. It was released under the Apache 2.0 open source license on November 9, 2015.

# Installation and Usage
Make sure you have install python environment, then `pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow`, to check whether it is installed nor not, you could use:
```python
>>> import tensorflow as tf
>>> hello = tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow!')
>>> sess = tf.Session()
>>> print(sess.run(hello))
```
In [tensorflow offical doc](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/), you can explore more about that, I hope in the future, I could explore tensorflow and do something interesting.
