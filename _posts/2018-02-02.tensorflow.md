# What is TensorFlow?
TensorFlow is a tool for machine learning. While it contains a wide range of functionality, TensorFlow is mainly designed for deep neural network models.
TensorFlow was developed by the Google Brain team for internal Google use. It was released under the Apache 2.0 open source license on November 9, 2015.

# Installation and Usage
Make sure you have install python environment, then `pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow`, to check whether it is installed nor not, you could use:
```python
>>> import tensorflow as tf
>>> hello = tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow!')
>>> sess = tf.Session()
>>> print(sess.run(hello))
```
In [tensorflow offical doc](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/), you can explore more about that, I hope in the future, I could explore tensorflow and do something interesting.

# Feature Columns
In TensorFlow, columns are divided into two types, cateforical or dense column.

What I want to talk about is Hashed Column. Sometimes there are more features than what we expect because of limited memory. So one way is to hash features into less buckets.

But some unrelated feature might be put into same bucket, this is a dilemma. As with many counterintuitive phenomena in machine learning, it turns out that hashing often works well in practice. That's because hash categories provide the model with some separation.
