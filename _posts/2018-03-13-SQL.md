# Using GROUPBY and USING keywords

Here we have a table `Person`
```
+----+---------+
| Id | Email   |
+----+---------+
| 1  | a@b.com |
| 2  | c@d.com |
| 3  | a@b.com |
+----+---------+
```

Write a SQL query to find all duplicate emails.

For this query, there might have many ways.
1. First, we consider find `Person` table twice
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT a.Email
FROM Person as a, Person as b
WHERE a.id != b.id and a.Email = b.Email
```
Runtime: 786ms

Or create temp table:
```sql
select Email, count(Email) as num
from Person
group by Email;
```

Then use
```sql
select Email from
(
  select Email, count(Email) as num
  from Person
  group by Email
) as statistic
where num > 1
;
```

2. Using `GROUPBY` and `USING` condition
```sql
select Email
from Person
group by Email
having count(Email) > 1;
```
This approach is more efficient and simpler.

# Using NULL Condition 
Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the `Employee` table.
```
+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
```

For example, given the above `Employee` table, the query should return 200 as the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return `null`.

1. First we create a temp table to solve `null` condition
```
SELECT
    (SELECT DISTINCT
            Salary
        FROM
            Employee
        ORDER BY Salary DESC
        LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1) AS SecondHighestSalary
;
```

Runtime: 636 ms

2. Consider `null` using `IFNULL`
```sql
SELECT
    IFNULL(
      (SELECT DISTINCT Salary
       FROM Employee
       ORDER BY Salary DESC
        LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1),
    NULL) AS SecondHighestSalary
```
Runtime: 588 ms

Above, it's better for us to first consider `null` condition

## Another problem:

The `Employee` table holds all employees including their managers. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the manager Id.

```
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| Id | Name  | Salary | ManagerId |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 3         |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 4         |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | NULL      |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | NULL      |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
```

Given the `Employee` table, write a SQL query that finds out employees who earn more than their managers. For the above table, Joe is the only employee who earns more than his manager.

1. First, use `JOIN` to deal with `null` condition
```sql
SELECT
     a.NAME AS Employee
FROM Employee AS a JOIN Employee AS b
     ON a.ManagerId = b.Id
     AND a.Salary > b.Salary
;
```

It's more efficient than

```
SELECT
    a.Name AS 'Employee'
FROM
    Employee AS a,
    Employee AS b
WHERE
    a.ManagerId = b.Id
        AND a.Salary > b.Salary
;
```

But if we directly consider `null` condition in `where` clause, it will also improve performance.

```sql
SELECT e1.Name as 'Employee'
FROM Employee as e1, Employee as e2
WHERE e1.ManagerId is not NULL and e1.ManagerId = e2.Id and e1.Salary > e2.Salary 
```
