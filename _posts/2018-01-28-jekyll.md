[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator for personal, project, or organization sites. Written in Ruby by Tom Preston-Werner, GitHub's co-founder, it is distributed under an open source license.

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) is designed to host your personal, organization, or project pages directly from a GitHub repository. 

To begin, create a new repository named as `yourname.github.io`, replace yourname with your usrname. 

Or just fork template from other repository like [jekyll now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now), then change name as above.
The structure of [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/) is like this:
```
.
├── _config.yml
├── _data
|   └── members.yml
├── _drafts
|   ├── begin-with-the-crazy-ideas.md
|   └── on-simplicity-in-technology.md
├── _includes
|   ├── footer.html
|   └── header.html
├── _layouts
|   ├── default.html
|   └── post.html
├── _posts
|   ├── 2007-10-29-why-every-programmer-should-play-nethack.md
|   └── 2009-04-26-barcamp-boston-4-roundup.md
├── _sass
|   ├── _base.scss
|   └── _layout.scss
├── _site
├── .jekyll-metadata
└── index.html # can also be an 'index.md' with valid YAML Frontmatter
```
If you just want to build a blog to write articles, I recommand you just use jekyll themes, they have beatiful UI and the only thing you need do is to change _config.yml(set your imformation instead). Then you can write your blog in posts folder. For themes, you can search on Google, like [jekyll-themes](http://jekyllthemes.org/)

 Every [post](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/) is written by markdown, and it follows:

The name of file should be xxxx-xx-xx-name.md, like 2018-01-28-jekyll.md, the date followed by name. In the beginning of posts, the first thing you should know the layout.

Jekyll can handle many different iterations of the idea you might associate with a “post,” however a standard blog style post, including a Title, Layout, Publishing Date, and Categories might look like this:
```
---
layout: post
title:  "Welcome to Jekyll!"
date:   2015-11-17 16:16:01 -0600
categories: jekyll update
---
```
Everything in between the first and second --- are part of the YAML Front Matter, and everything after the second --- will be rendered with Markdown and show up as “Content”.

Then you can write anything in [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) language below `---`.

After you have done posts, then you could push to your repository.

Also you could deploy locally:
* Install Jekyll and plug-ins in one fell swoop. gem install github-pages This mirrors the plug-ins used by GitHub Pages on your local machine including Jekyll, Sass, etc.
* Clone down your fork git clone `https://github.com/yourusername/yourusername.github.io.git`
* Serve the site and watch for `markup/sass` changes `jekyll serve`
* View your website at `http://127.0.0.1:4000/`
* Commit any changes and push everything to the master branch of your GitHub user repository. GitHub Pages will then rebuild and serve your website.
