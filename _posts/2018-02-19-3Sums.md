# 3Sums
Given an array S of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in S such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.
```
For example, given array S = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4],

A solution set is:
[
  [-1, 0, 1],
  [-1, -1, 2]
]
```

The key is to sort array first, then we fix `1st` number, the `2nd` and `3rd` number can be found following the same reasoning as `TwoSum`. 

```python
class Solution:
    def threeSum(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: List[List[int]]
        """
        nums.sort()
        res = []
        if not nums or nums[0] > 0 or len(nums) < 3:
            return []
        for i in range(len(nums) - 2):
            if (i == 0 or (i > 0 and nums[i] != nums[i-1])):
                sum = 0 - nums[i]
                lo, hi = i+1,len(nums)-1
                while lo < hi and nums[lo] <= sum:
                    if nums[lo] + nums[hi] == sum:
                        res.append([nums[i],nums[lo],nums[hi]])
                        # skip dulicated numbers
                        while nums[lo] == nums[lo+1] and lo+1 < hi:
                            lo += 1
                        while nums[hi] == nums[hi-1] and hi-1 > lo:
                            hi -= 1
                        lo += 1
                        hi -= 1
                    elif nums[lo] + nums[hi] < sum:
                        lo += 1
                    else: hi -= 1
        return list(res)
```

# Sort Colors

Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

Note:
You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

This problem we use two pointers, one is from start, the other is from end. If current number is 0 then swap with low number, if current num is 2 then swap with high number. Sometimes I just looks like simple, but you might miss some test cases. It's hard to complete everything for one round, like life, no one could walk down only one path. You will fail, but the key is to stand up again.

```python
class Solution:
    def sortColors(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: void Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        if not nums or len(nums) < 2:
            return
        lo,hi = 0,len(nums)-1
        i = lo
        while(i<=hi):
            if nums[i] == 0 and i > lo:
                nums[lo],nums[i] = nums[i],nums[lo]
                lo += 1
            elif nums[i] == 2:
                nums[hi],nums[i] = nums[i],nums[hi]
                hi -= 1
            else:
                i += 1
```
