# Backend Knowledge

We use JavaScript, specifically, Node.js, to set up the environment, see environment-setup

## Node.js

Node is an open-source, cross-platform, runtime environment that allows developers to create all kinds of server-side tools and applications in JavaScript.

### NPM

NPM is the most important tool for working with Node applications. NPM is used to fetch any packages (JavaScript libraries) that an application needs for development, testing, and/or production, and may also be used to run tests and tools used in the development process.

Typically we instead manage dependencies using a plain-text definition file named `package.json`. This file lists all the dependencies for a specific `JavaScript` "package", including the package's name, version, description, initial file to execute, production dependencies, development dependencies, versions of Node it can work with, etc. The `package.json` file should contain everything NPM needs to fetch and run your application (if you were writing a reusable library you could use this definition to upload your package to the npm respository and make it available for other users).

For the first time to init a project, use `npm init`, it will generate `package.json` for you. And to install packages like Express, use `npm install express --save`. `--save` means install it locally in your project. Also we can use `npm install express --save-dev`, `-dev` means install only for development mode, so that packages will not be installed for production.

Since we have already init npm, the only thing to do is type `npm install`, to install all packages into node_modules folder.

## [Express](https://expressjs.com/)

This is a web framework for NodeJS that’s perfect for managing http request, creating middlewares, routing endpoints, etc. We will use it to expose the information of the application.

Express is the most popular Node web framework, and is the underlying library for a number of other popular Node web frameworks. It provides mechanisms to:

- Write handlers for requests with different HTTP verbs at different URL paths (routes).
- Integrate with "view" rendering engines in order to generate responses by inserting data into templates.
- Set common web application settings like the port to use for connecting, and the location of templates that are used for rendering the response.
- Add additional request processing "middleware" at any point within the request handling pipeline.

Here is a good tutorial showing the usage, please visit [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Tutorial_local_library_website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Tutorial_local_library_website)
It includes 7 parts, though it is different from our project in some degree, but it's simpler and easier to learn first, and then can deep into testtracker easily.

Express app basic structure

```bash
    app.js
    /bin
        www
    package.json
    /node_modules
    /public
        /images
        /js
        /css
    /routes
    /models
    /controllers
    /views
```

`app.js` is the entry point of the app, the name is a convention. `/bin/www` is the start scripting file to load `app.js` and start the server. Based on `MVC` pattern, `/views` folder contains all view models, `/models` contains all models, the same as `/controllers`. `/public` is used to store public files like `images`, `javascripts`, `css` and other resources. There are other more files will be discussed later.

Express provides methods to specify what function is called for a particular HTTP verb (GET, POST, SET, etc.) and URL pattern ("Route"), and methods to specify what template ("view") engine is used, where template files are located, and what template to use to render a response. You can use Express middleware to add support for cookies, sessions, and users, getting POST/GET parameters, etc. You can use any database mechanism supported by Node (Express does not define any database-related behaviour).

### www file

The file /bin/www is the application entry point! The very first thing this does is require() the "real" application entry point (app.js, in the project root) that sets up and returns the express() application object. See /bin/www for more details.

### app.js

This file creates an express application object (named app, by convention), sets up the application with various settings and middleware, and then exports the app from the module.

In app.js, we set up view engine with `express-handlebars`, as

```javascript
app.engine(
  ".hbs",
  hbs({
    extname: ".hbs", // define file extention name
    defaultLayout: "base", // set the dedault base layout base.hbs
    layoutsDir: `${__dirname}/views/layouts`, // set the path of layouts
    // handlebars helpers
    helpers: {
      default: hbsHelper(), // this is the default helpers using module handlebars-helpers
      raw: raw() // handlebars templates helper
    },
    // handlebars can load partials into layouts, this is to set the path of partials
    partialsDir: [
      //  path to your partials
      `${__dirname}/views/partials`,
      `${__dirname}/views/partials/managers`,
      `${__dirname}/views/partials/js`
      // __dirname + '/views/partials/header',
    ]
  })
);
```

### Architecture

- "Routes" to forward the supported requests (and any information encoded in request URLs) to the appropriate controller functions.

- Controller functions to get the requested data from the models, create an HTML page displaying the data, and return it to the user to view in the browser.

- Views (templates) used by the controllers to render the data.

![arch](https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/14456/MVC%20Express.png)

### Routes

Routing refers to how an application’s endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests.

A route is a section of Express code that associates an HTTP verb (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.), an URL path/pattern, and a function that is called to handle that pattern.

The `routes/index.js` file has the information of the route needed to execute a specific get/post/put request. This file has the necessary information needed to know the link between the route and the controller.

Use the express.Router class to create modular, mountable route handlers. A Router instance is a complete middleware and routing system; for this reason, it is often referred to as a “mini-app”.

We have five rounters routing login, manager, engineers, projects, project-detail pages.

First this route file loads the express module, and uses it to get an express.Router object. Then it specifies a route on that object, and lastly exports the router from the module (this is what allows the file to be imported into app.js). For example, in `app.js`

The following example creates a router as a module, loads a middleware function in it, defines some routes, and mounts the router module on a path in the main app.

```javascript
import login from "./routes/login";
app.use("/login", login);
```

For route `login.js`, we have

```javascript
var express = require("express");
var router = express.Router();

router.get("/", function(req, res, next) {
  res.send("respond with a resource");
});

module.exports = router;
```

The route defines a callback that will be invoked whenever an HTTP GET request with the correct pattern is detected. The matching pattern is the route specified when the module is imported ('`/login'`) plus whatever is defined in this file (`'/'`). In other words, this route will be used when an URL of `/login/`is received.

#### Route parameters

Route parameters are named URL segments that are used to capture the values specified at their position in the URL. The captured values are populated in the req.params object, with the name of the route parameter specified in the path as their respective keys. To get parameters from url use `req.params` which is json object.

```json
Route path: /users/:userId/books/:bookId
Request URL: http://localhost:3000/users/34/books/8989
req.params: { "userId": "34", "bookId": "8989" }
```

Another type of parameters is for POST request, the parameters can be queried using `req.body`.

### Controllers

Controller functions to get the requested data from the models, create an HTML page displaying the data, and return it to the user to view in the browser.

The controllers contain the `get/post/put/delete` requests that are used to get information from the database, add information, and update it. Each database model has a controller. In `routes/index.js`, we map the RESTful API to controllers.

### Models

The models are the database models. Each model defines what information is held in the database (definition), and the relations between items (association).

## Axios

[Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) is promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js.

- Make [`XMLHttpRequests`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest) from the browser.
- Make [`http`](http://nodejs.org/api/http.html) requests from node.js
- Supports the [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) API
- Intercept request and response
- Transform request and response data
- Cancel requests
- Automatic transforms for JSON data
- Client side support for protecting against XSRF

For example,

```javascript
//get method
axios.get(url).then(res => {
  let data = res.data; // the data we need
});

//post method, we also use put method which is almost the same as post, but less requests comparing with post
const formData = new FormData(); //the data we want to send to server
formData.append("id", 1); // append data using key value pairs

axios.post(url, formdata).then(res => {
  let data = res.data; // the same
});
```

## HTTP request method

Good resourses to learn, visit [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods)

## RESTful API

[REST](https://restfulapi.net/) is acronym for **RE**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer. We defined our APIs are at `/routes/index.js`.

## Database

After installing PostgreSQL, we can use command line to create/delete a new database. Also we can connect to databases to execute SQL statements. Either use the `psql` command, or specify a database such as the default postgres database to connect.

```bash
createdb mydatabasename
dropdb mydatabasename
psql postgres
```

In `server/config/config.json`, we have username, password, database and dialect, you can specify your own username, password and databsename.

```json
{
  "development": {
    "username": "postgres",
    "password": "postgres",
    "database": "testtracker",
    "dialect": "postgres",
    "operatorsAliases": false
  },
  "test": {
    "username": "postgres",
    "password": "postgres",
    "database": "testtracker",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "dialect": "postgres"
  },
  "production": {
    "username": "postgres",
    "password": "postgres",
    "database": "testtracker",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "dialect": "postgres"
  }
}
```

## Postman

[Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) is the only complete API development environment, for API developers, used by more than 5 million developers and 100000 companies worldwide. We use postman to develop and test our API, [see more about using it](https://learning.getpostman.com/getting-started/)

## Datatables

For backend, we need server side processing, deal with pagination, filtering, searching and ordering.

We have a function to deal with the table queries,

```javascript
// parse datatable requests, see https://datatables.net/manual/server-side
const tableQuery = function tableQuery(req, res) {
  // get query info
  const { draw, start, length, columns, search, order } = req.query;
  const filters = []; // store filter condition
  const orderQuery = [columns[order[0].column].data, order[0].dir]; // columns order info
  console.log(orderQuery);

  // get filter info from every column
  columns.forEach(col => {
    if (col.search.value != "") {
      filters.push({
        name: col.data,
        regex: col.search.regex,
        value: col.search.value
      });
    }
  });

  // sequelize operator
  const conditions = filters.map(filter => {
    const op = {};
    tmp[filter.name] =
      filter.regex === "true"
        ? {
            [Op.regexp]: filter.value
          }
        : {
            [Op.eq]: filter.value
          };
    return op;
  });

  // store into request
  req.draw = parseInt(draw, 10); // parse str to int
  req.conditions = conditions;
  req.orderQuery = orderQuery;
  req.start = start;
  req.length = length;
  return req;
};
```

## express-fileupload

Simple express middleware for uploading files.

See usage [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-fileupload#usage)

## [json2csvParser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json2csv#json2csv-parser-synchronous-api)

We use json2csv to convert json into csv with column titles and proper line endings.
Can be used as a module and from the command line.

```javascript
// define the columns of csv
const fields = [
      { label: 'id', value: 'itemNumber' },
      'name',
      'status',
      'taskRank',
      'currentStage',
      'milestone',
      'priority',
      'techRisk',
      'notes',
      'Subfunctions',
      { label: 'resource', value: 'User.name' } // User is an object we only want the attribute name.
    ];
    const json2csvParser = new Json2csvParser({ fields }); // init parser
    const csv = json2csvParser.parse(items); // parse data into csv

    fs.writeFile(`public/res/${filename}.csv`, csv, (err) => {
      if (err) {
        console.log(err);
      }
      res.send(`/res/${filename}.csv`); // success
```

## exceljs

Read, manipulate and write spreadsheet data and styles to XLSX and JSON.

Reverse engineered from Excel spreadsheet files as a project.

We use it in `itemController`, for more [exceljs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/exceljs)

```javascript
const workbook = new Excel.Workbook();
const worksheet = workbook.addWorksheet();
worksheet.columns = [
  { header: "Id", key: "itemNumber", width: 10 },
  { header: "Name", key: "name", width: 10 },
  { header: "Status", key: "status", width: 15 },
  { header: "CurrentStage", key: "currentStage", width: 20 },
  { header: "Subfunctions", key: "Subfunctions", width: 15 },
  { header: "Milestone", key: "milestone", width: 15 },
  { header: "Priority", key: "priority", width: 15 },
  { header: "TechRisk", key: "techRisk", width: 15 },
  { header: "Notes", key: "notes", width: 15 }
];
worksheet.addRows(items);
workbook.xlsx.writeFile(`public/res/${filename}.xlsx`).then(() => {
  // done
  res.send(`/res/${filename}.xlsx`);
});
```
