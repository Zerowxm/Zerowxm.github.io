# Introduction
Count the number of prime numbers less than a non-negative number, n.
Here is the intuition, We start off with a table of n numbers. Let's look at the first number, 2. We know all multiples of 2 must not be primes, so we mark them off as non-primes. Then we look at the next number, 3. Similarly, all multiples of 3 such as 3 × 2 = 6, 3 × 3 = 9, ... must not be primes, so we mark them off as well. Now we look at the next number, 4, which was already marked off. In the end, we could get all prime numbers

# Implementation
```python
class Solution:
    def countPrimes(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
                    
        if n <= 2:
            return 0
        primes = [True] * n
        primes[:2] = [False] * 2
        for base in range(2, int((n - 1) ** 0.5) + 1):
            if primes[base]:
                primes[base ** 2::base] = [False] * len(primes[base ** 2::base])
        return sum(primes)
```
Because numbers LESS THAN n are considered, we can just (n - 1) ** 0.5, follow the intuition, base must be prime, so we just consider from base^2 to the end, that is base^2 + base, base^2 + 2base,base^2 + 3base...there are all non-primes. The key is to mark multiples of primes.
